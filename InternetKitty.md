### Netcat
- Netcat (or nc in short) is a simple yet powerful networking command-line tool used for performing any operation in Linux related to TCP, UDP, or UNIX-domain sockets.  
- Netcat can be used for port scanning, port redirection, as a port listener (for incoming connections); it can also be used to open remote connections and so many other things.
