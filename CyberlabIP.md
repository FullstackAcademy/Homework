# Cyberlab IP

## Solution

In order to solve this problem we need to make a request to the server using the dig command.  I used the +short option to just display the IP address.

The screenshot below demonstrates how to successfully retrieve the IP address.

### Dig Command

- By default, the dig command will display the A record when no other options are specified. The output will also contain other information like the installed dig version, technical details about the answers, statistics about the query, a question section along with few other ones.
### +short option

- `+short` This option after the web address will just return IP address without other information.
