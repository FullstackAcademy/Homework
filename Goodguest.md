## Solution
- Use command host for linux.fullstackacademy.com which returned that it was alias for shell.fullstackacademy.com.  Flag format is the record type and IP address and I typed it into the screen shot.

### Record type
- record type for alias is CNAME

### Host Command
- Host command is a minimal and easy-to-use CLI utility for performing DNS lookups which translate domain names to IP addresses and vice versa.
